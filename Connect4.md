From the start I am going to work on the div to make the board which will equal to 42 dives and that will be 7 rows and 6 columns after the html is setup 
start on the css which will make everything come to life. Using css define the borders, colors, and the With, hight for the game. Start working on the js 
which will make the game work. First define all your const to start off then start adding your element selector. To start off you want to get all the basic 
done before you start working on your win logic. Start making your board inside an array. Then define the elements for your buttons. After your get the basic 
done you want to start off by wring down how you want to work on the win logic, First you can work on the vertical and horizontal which will lead you to work on
the diagonal win logic.
